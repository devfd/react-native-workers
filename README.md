# react-native-workers

Spin worker threads and run CPU intensive tasks in the background. Bonus point on Android you can keep a worker alive even when a user quit the application :fireworks:

## Features
- JS web workers for iOS and Android
- access to native modules (network, geolocation, storage ...)
- Android Services in JS :tada:

## Installation

```bash
npm install react-native-workers --save
```

### Automatic setup

Simply run one of the following commands and you're good to go.

#### react-native >= 0.28.0

simply run `react-native link`

#### react-native < 0.28.0

`rnpm link react-native-workers`

### Manual setup

#### iOS

1. Open your project in XCode, right click on Libraries and click Add Files to "Your Project Name". Look under node_modules/react-native-workers/ios and add `Workers.xcodeproj`
2. Add `libWorkers.a` to `Build Phases -> Link Binary With Libraries`

#### Android

in `android/settings.gradle`

```
 include ':app', ':react-native-workers'
 project(':react-native-workers').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../node_modules/react-native-workers/android')
 ```

in `android/app/build.gradle` add:

```
dependencies {
   ...
   compile project(':react-native-workers')
}
```

and finally, in your `MainApplication.java` add:

```java

import co.apptailor.Worker.WorkerPackage; // <--- This!

public class MainApplication extends Application implements ReactApplication {

private final ReactNativeHost mReactNativeHost = new ReactNativeHost(this) {
    @Override
    protected boolean getUseDeveloperSupport() {
      return BuildConfig.DEBUG;
    }

    @Override
    protected List<ReactPackage> getPackages() {
      return Arrays.<ReactPackage>asList(
          new MainReactPackage(),
          new WorkerPackage() // <--- and this
      );
    }
  };

  @Override
  public ReactNativeHost getReactNativeHost() {
      return mReactNativeHost;
  }
}

```

**Note**: only the official react native modules are available from your workers (vibration, fetch, etc...). To include additional modules in your workers add them to the WorkerPackage constructor. Like this:

```java
new WorkerPackage(new MyAwesomePackage(), new MyAmazingPackage())`
```

## JS API

From your application:
```js
import { Worker } from 'react-native-workers';

/* start worker */
const worker = new Worker("path/to/worker.js");

/* post message to worker. String only ! */
worker.postMessage("hello from application");

/* get message from worker. String only ! */
worker.onmessage = (message) => {

}

/* stop worker */
worker.terminate();

```

From your worker js file:
```js
import { self } from 'react-native-workers';

/* get message from application. String only ! */
self.onmessage = (message) => {
}

/* post message to application. String only ! */
self.postMessage("hello from worker");
```

## Lifecycle

- the workers are paused when the app enters in the background
- the workers are resumed once the app is running in the foreground
- During development, when you reload the main JS bundle (shake device -> `Reload`) the workers are killed

## Todo

- [x] Android - download worker files from same location as main bundle
- [x] iOS - download worker files from same location as main bundle
- [ ] script to package worker files for release build
- [x] load worker files from disk if not debug
